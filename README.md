# Credits
- __GROK__ - The brains behind the operation. I've been playing with AI and code generation for a few months, most are hit and miss when the rubber meets the road. Impressively, the first attempt at generating this project ran in my local node environment, very impressive IMO. Grok happily (and hurmoursly in some cases) generated modifications including sound and effects as well as helped me deploy the game on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). ([PLAY HERE](https://wheat-short-danthus.glitch.me/)). Well done [Grok AI Team](https://github.com/xai-org)!!! :  https://grok.com/

- __Glitch__ - Thanks to Glitch for hosting this app on your easy to use platform. I highly recommend [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to deploy and share node.js prototypes, awesome service!

Running Local:

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is installed locally, ideally using a version management tool like [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
2. Install dependencies using NVM - from terminal window in project root, run: `nvm install`
3. Start the project - from terminal window in project root, run: `node server`
